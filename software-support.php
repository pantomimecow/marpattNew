			<p>Marpatt are endeavoring to work as closely as possible with as many software providers as possible, liaising with them on a regular basis and making sure product ranges and prices are kept up to date.</p>
			<p>All Marpatt products are maintained and available on the easyquote system.</p>
			<p>Easyquote is a business management system that allows kitchen and bedroom designers and manufacturers to manage their customer interactions (CRM), produce professional quotations, place purchase orders, manage stock, manage projects, import from their CAD system and much, much more.</p>
			<p>Easyquote’s Data Services Director, Ben Pursglove commented, “By working in partnership with Marpatt, our mutual customers are able to quickly and easily specify products from Marpatt’s massive product offer” he added “designs can be re-priced in different door styles at the touch of a button and placing purchase orders is just as simple. This takes the headache, error factor and long manual work that can be involved out of the equation”</p>
			<p>Existing easyquote users will be pleased to know that over the coming weeks, we will be adding technical images to the easyquote catalogues.</p>

			<h3>ArtiCAD</h3>
			<img src="img/Articad Logo.jpeg" alt="">
			<p>The complete range of Marpatt’s kitchen and bedrooms doors is now included in the ArtiCAD-Pro CAD software product. Users of the software can quickly and easily search for and select their doors of choice, and then simply drag &amp; drop them into their kitchen or bedroom design.</p>
			<p>Marpatt considered a number of different suppliers of CAD packages for the KBB industry, selecting ArtiCAD as one of their preferred partners.</p>
			<p>“We are very enthusiastic about ArtiCAD’s integration with easyquote,. Not only does the ArtiCAD-Pro and easyquote integration provide our customers with a complete design and pricing solution, it is also paving the way for us to be amongst one of the first to adopt the new ArtiQuote system from ArtiCAD, which is powered by an easyquote database.” Richard Saunders, Sales &amp; Marketing, Marpatt.</p>
			<p>Based in Leicester, Marpatt is a family-owned company established more than twenty five years ago. The company’s range of classic and modern kitchen (and more recently bedroom) doors is supplied to the KBB industry throughout the UK. More than 150 different mid-to top-of-the-range doors from Marpatt are now included in the ArtiCAD-Pro catalogue.</p>
			<p>“Our customers find it so much simpler to be able to show their clients designs which incorporate the specific doors they have chosen, rather than expecting them to use their imagination or just see generic doors within a design. Together with easyquote, both products enable clients to be provided with a great deal of information and detail which is easy to see and easy to understand. And the easier it is to understand, the faster it is to sell.”</p>
			<p>The Marpatt catalogue within ArtiCAD-Pro will be constantly updated as the company adds to its range. ArtiCAD and Marpatt will also be working closely together on joint marketing and promotional activities, under the auspices of the ArtiCAD Supplier Partnership, to ensure that designers have access to the greatest design software and the full range of Marpatt doors.</p>
